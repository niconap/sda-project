**Group members:**
- Shriya Bang

## Description
Our project aims to find out what the most influential factors (out of the ones
given in the dataset) are for Alzheimer’s disease. This way, it might be possible
to predict whether or not someone has Alzheimer’s disease by just taking these
measurements and comparing them to what is already known from the dataset.

## Installation and running the files
The project consists of multiple Jupyter Notebooks, of which the title indicates
the content. We recommend to create a virtual environment to install all
dependencies in `requirements.txt`.
